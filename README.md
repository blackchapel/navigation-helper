# RideLink

A two-role Android app for a rider (phone mounted on the bike, hands-free
once riding starts) and a pillion (picks the destination). The pillion
builds a route in the real Google Maps app and taps Share; RideLink
captures that share, sends it directly to the rider's phone over a local
Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connection (Google's Nearby Connections API), and the
rider's phone automatically opens Google Maps navigation. **No backend --
the entire handoff, including voice chat, is phone-to-phone.**

For the technical architecture and module-by-module breakdown, see
`docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`. Known open limitations are tracked in
`docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md`.

## Features

1. Both people open RideLink, grant Bluetooth/nearby-device permissions,
   and pick a role: Rider or Pillion. Pairing is per-ride only -- both
   sides re-discover each other fresh every session, nothing is
   remembered device-to-device.
2. Pillion opens Google Maps, builds the route, taps **Share -> RideLink**.
   RideLink sends the link to the rider's phone the moment both a
   connection and a captured link exist -- and again for every
   subsequent share, not just the first.
3. Rider's phone automatically launches Google Maps navigation, even if
   RideLink itself is backgrounded (a foreground service keeps it
   listening) or the rider's phone is locked. A tapped "new route"
   notification also opens it, as a second path.
4. Once connected, either phone can start a **voice chat** call (the
   other side must accept). While active: mute toggle, and an output
   picker (speaker / earpiece / Bluetooth). Audio flows over the same
   Nearby Connections link -- still no internet or mobile data.
5. Light/dark theme toggle in the header, persisted across restarts
   (defaults to the system theme on first launch).

## Building

Requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (platform 35, build-tools matching
AGP 8.7.2). Two ways to build:

- **Locally in Android Studio**: open the project root and let it sync.
  `./gradlew assembleDebug` works with no extra setup.
  `./gradlew assembleRelease` requires the signing environment variables
  below -- without them it fails at the signing step, which is expected.
- **CI (the actual build path used day to day)**: two GitHub Actions
  workflows, both producing a **signed** release APK (see
  `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md` for full detail):
  - **Test Release** (`build-apk.yml`) -- manually triggered, pick any
    branch. Use this to get a signed build of work-in-progress onto a
    test device.
  - **Production Release** (`release.yml`) -- runs automatically on every
    push to `main`.
  - Both need these repository secrets configured: `KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
    `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`, and
    `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (build results, versioned and tagged, are
    posted to Discord). No key material lives in this repo.
  - The app's semantic version lives in `app/version.properties` --
    bump it by hand when intended; build number (`versionCode`) is
    always derived automatically from commit count.

No API keys, accounts, or `local.properties` entries beyond the standard
`sdk.dir` are needed for the app itself -- there's no backend and no
Maps/Places API usage of our own (Google Maps itself handles all of
that, launched via intent).

## Contributing workflow

New work happens on a feature branch, never directly on `main`:
1. Push the feature branch and run the **Test Release** workflow against
   it to get a signed build onto a real device.
2. Once that's tested and approved, open a PR into `main`.
3. Merge only happens on explicit approval -- merging triggers the
   automatic **Production Release** build.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full detail (including keeping `README.md`,
`docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`, and `docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md` current with every
change).

## Testing

Nearby Connections behavior is unreliable on emulators, so use two
physical Android devices:

1. Install the same signed build on both (a Test Release APK, not two
   separately-signed debug builds -- see Building above for why that
   matters), grant Bluetooth/nearby-device permissions when prompted, and
   enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi if asked.
2. Device A: "I'm the Pillion". Device B: "I'm the Rider". Both screens
   should show "Connected" within a few seconds.
3. On Device A, open Google Maps, build a route, Share -> RideLink.
   Device A shows "Route sent". Device B should automatically launch
   Google Maps navigation with no further taps -- try this again with
   Device B's screen off/RideLink backgrounded, and again while it's
   already mid-navigation from a previous share.
4. Voice chat: from either device, start a voice chat; the other device
   should show an incoming-call prompt. Accept, confirm audio flows both
   ways, try mute, and try switching output (speaker/earpiece/Bluetooth
   if a headset is paired). Repeat with the other device as the caller.
